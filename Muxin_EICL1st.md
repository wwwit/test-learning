#### 有关 A-Programmers-Guide-to-English

之前看过这份指南，今天又回顾了一下，记录一下重点和感想：

- “语言的学习，是学习双方都能理解的表达方式和表达思维”，“语言的表达不能通过转换为自己熟悉的语言再转换”

  - 有时候 Chinglish 就是在用中文的思维或者直译的方式在表达，很容易让对方摸不着头脑或者直接误解你的意思，当在跟 native speaker 对话的时候，你想要交流的是对方，所以要让对方听的懂，而不是让自己听的懂/舒服，所以要学会对方的思维模式和表达方式。

- 几个很好的工具，我平时也在用的：

  - 单词不认识或者发音不确定：[Cambridge Dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/)
    - 单词解释也是英文的，这样可以避免一些中文思维，还能学到新的知识
    - 英式和美式发音都有
    - 同义词、反义词、例子都有
  - 单词用法以及发音：[YouGlish](https://youglish.com/pronounce/clump/english/us)
    - 里面截取了很多包含你搜索的单词的视频片段，你可以学习到不同的人在不同的实际场景是如何使用这个词的，还有发音
  - Google Translate，我在考试的时候用的比较多，自己读单词或句子让它来识别，如果识别不对可能是发音有问题
  - Anki，我也用过，但是坚持不下来，目前本人已经不背单词了，记单词的方法就是多看/多听，次数多了就记住了，有时候也会用笔手写在笔记本上，写一遍也会加深印象，但如果平时用不着也会很快忘记

  当然目前已经有很多 AI 工具了，特别是 ChatGPT，可以跟 TA 问问题或者练习对话，也是挺不错的。
